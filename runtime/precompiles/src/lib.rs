//! Ported from Precompiles for SP1 zkVM.
//!
//! Specifically, this crate contains user-friendly functions that call SP1 syscalls. Syscalls are
//! also declared here for convenience. In order to avoid duplicate symbol errors, the syscall
//! function impls must live in sp1-zkvm, which is only imported into the end user program crate.
//! In contrast, sp1-precompiles can be imported into any crate in the dependency tree.
